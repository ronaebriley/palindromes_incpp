Program Instructional Guide
- Intro
The term palindrome is define as a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of
characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as MADAM or KAYAK.
The term “palindrome” has Greek roots from the words palin (“again”) and dromos
(“way, direction”) by way of the English writer Ben Jonson. Some palindromes seem
to be philosophical. Others tell a story. In any case, they are unique and often times
creatively thoughtful compositions of literature used for constrained writing.
For this program, you will write a program that utilizes pointers for palindrome
testing. The program is a simulated interaction of an airline account creation. The
account parameters will consist of a passenger name, password and pin. Once the
account has been created the program will test if the passenger’s password is a
palindrome and print the result out to the screen (i.e, palindrome, not a palindrome).
Program Objectives
The goal of this project is to create a C++ program that will help to develop your
programming skills in understanding the implementation of specifically pointers, in
addition to developing void functions, structures and conditionals. The simulated airline
account creation will initially ask the user to enter a name, birthdate, password and pin.
You should have a welcome introduction to your airline ticket purchaser notifying them
of the name of your commercial airline.
- Palindrome Function
Your program will then create a function (check_Palindrome) that will test whether
the passenger’s password is a palindrome or not. If the password entered is a
palindrome, the palindrome string will be printed to the screen with a prompt notifying
the user of the password palindrome status. Similarly, if the password is not a
palindrome a print statement notifying the user that the string is not a palindrome is

Program Requirements (Note: Students program must follow these requirements,
points will be deducted if your program fails to implement all of the requirements listed.)
Here is a checklist of things that your program should include:
• Create a passenger account by entering a name, password, birthdate and pin,
use the account information in the program.
• Validate the user input (For example, make sure that the passenger account
input entered corresponds to the datatype declared initially).
• Your program must use pointers in both the palindrome and permutation
functions.
• Your program must have a function similar to the (check_Palindrome) that
will test whether the passenger’s password is a palindrome or not.
• Your program must implement a function similar to rotate_Positions shown
above that should be used to change and also temporary store the rotation of
each character in the string.
• Give appropriate feedback so it's clear to the customer how the program is
progressing and what is the next step or input needed to complete the account
creation.
• Provide a short introduction to your program and a conclusion.
• Your program must use at least one (1) functions: check_Palindrome ( )
,(1) conditional (if/if else/elif) statements, (1) for and/or while loops and the
use of pointers as defined above in the program objectives.
• Your main function should not do all the work; it should call other functions to
run the "guts" of the program.
• You must use comments in your source code to explain the flow of the
program.
